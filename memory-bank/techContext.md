## Components Interaction

The components of the `llm-planning-app` project interact as follows:

1. The user interacts with the application through the command-line interface.
2. The `llm_planner.py` file acts as the entry point for the application.
3. The application reads and analyzes the project files and directories to generate intelligent content for the memory bank files.
4. The memory bank files provide context and information for generating plans and updating the memory bank.
5. The application can generate a comprehensive plan for implementing a feature based on the user's input and the content from the memory bank files.
6. The application can update specific memory bank files with new insights provided by the user.

The interaction between the components allows the `llm-planning-app` to provide intelligent planning and documentation features based on code analysis.
