# Product Context Document

## Overview

The LLM Planner is a Python command-line application designed for planning and documenting tasks with large language models (LLMs). It provides a terminal-based interface with whimsical output and leverages artificial intelligence to generate intelligent content based on deep code analysis.

## Features

- Terminal-based interface with whimsical output
- AI-powered "Memory Bank" generation based on deep code analysis
- Hierarchical codebase summarization (files → directories → project)
- Smart plan generation using context from actual code
- AI-assisted clarification for ambiguous requirements
- Memory bank updating with LLM assistance
- Support for OpenAI, with placeholders for Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic and Azure OpenAI
- Project structure and pattern analysis

## Target Users

The LLM Planner is intended for software developers and teams who want to efficiently plan and document tasks using AI-generated insights. It is especially useful for projects with large codebases and complex requirements.

## Problem Statement

Planning and documenting tasks in software development can be time-consuming and error-prone. Understanding the codebase, identifying requirements, and creating a comprehensive plan can be challenging, especially in large projects. The LLM Planner aims to solve these problems by leveraging AI to analyze the codebase, generate intelligent content, and assist in clarifying ambiguous requirements, resulting in more accurate and efficient task planning.

## User Stories

As a software developer, I want to:
- Generate a comprehensive plan for implementing a feature based on code analysis
- Receive AI-assisted clarification for ambiguous requirements
- Update my memory bank with new insights and seamlessly integrate them
- Analyze the project structure and identify recurring patterns and conventions
- Use a terminal-based interface for planning and documentation tasks

## Requirements

- The LLM Planner should provide a terminal-based interface for user interaction.
- The application should be able to analyze the codebase and generate intelligent content for the memory bank files.
- AI should be used to assist in clarifying ambiguous requirements during the planning process.
- The memory bank files should be updatable with new insights and seamlessly integrated using AI.
- The LLM Planner should be able to analyze the project structure and identify recurring patterns and conventions.
- The application should support OpenAI, with placeholders for Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic and Azure OpenAI.

## Next Steps

Based on the analysis, the next steps for the LLM Planner project could include:
- Implementing the memory bank generation functionality
- Developing the AI-assisted clarification feature
- Adding the ability to update memory bank files with new insights
- Creating the project structure and pattern analysis feature
- Integrating support for OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic, and Azure OpenAI
