## System Patterns

This document outlines the design patterns, architectural decisions, and structural hierarchies within the project.

- **Hierarchical Analysis:** The system breaks down complexity via a layered approach:
  - **Files → Directories → Project Summary.**
- **Inter-File Dependencies:** The `projectbrief.md` informs `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md`, all of which feed into `activeContext.md`.
- **Design Philosophy:** Emphasizes clear separation of concerns and iterative updates, ensuring that the memory bank remains accurate even after resets.
- **Patterns:** Focus on recurring structures, modular design, and detailed progress documentation.
