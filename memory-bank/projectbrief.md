# Project Brief

## Purpose
The purpose of the llm-planning-app project is to provide a Python command-line application for planning and documenting tasks using large language models (LLMs). It aims to assist developers in generating comprehensive plans, clarifying requirements, and maintaining a memory bank based on deep code analysis.

## Goals
- Provide a terminal-based interface for easy interaction with the application
- Generate an AI-powered "Memory Bank" based on deep code analysis
- Summarize the project's codebase hierarchy, including files, directories, and the overall project architecture
- Generate smart plans by using context from the actual code
- Assist in clarifying ambiguous requirements using AI assistance
- Update the memory bank with new insights using LLM assistance
- Support for OpenAI with plans for integration with Amazon Bedrock/Anthropic and Azure OpenAI
- Analyze project structure and identify coding patterns

## Target Audience
The llm-planning-app is targeted towards developers who want to streamline their planning and documentation process. It is particularly useful for teams working with large codebases and complex projects.

## Technical Architecture
The llm-planning-app is written in Python and does not utilize any specific frameworks. It consists of several files, including `llm_planner.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`, `example_task.txt`, and `plan.md`. The application utilizes deep code analysis to generate an AI-powered memory bank and to provide smart plan generation.

## Scope
The llm-planning-app focuses on providing planning and documentation assistance to developers. It analyzes the project structure, codebase, and coding patterns to generate an AI-powered memory bank. The application can generate comprehensive plans for implementing features, assist in clarifying requirements, and update the memory bank with new insights. The llm-planning-app also supports integration with OpenAI and has plans for integrating with other AI platforms in the future.
