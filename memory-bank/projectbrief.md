## Project Brief

The **llm-planning-app** is a Python command-line application designed to plan and document tasks with the help of large language models (LLMs). This project serves as the foundation, outlining core requirements, goals, and the overall scope. It features:

- A whimsical, terminal-based interface
- AI-powered memory bank generation using deep code analysis
- Hierarchical document summarization from files to directories to the project level

This file is the single source of truth from which all other memory bank documents derive their context.
