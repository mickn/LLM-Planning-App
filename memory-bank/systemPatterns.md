# Code Analysis and Best Practices

## Introduction
This document provides an analysis of the codebase for the **llm-planning-app** project. It identifies recurring patterns, coding conventions, and best practices used throughout the codebase. The analysis covers naming conventions, architectural patterns, design patterns, and coding standards.

## Naming Conventions
The codebase follows the following naming conventions:

- **Modules**: Python modules are named using snake_case.
- **Functions**: Function names are also written in snake_case.
- **Variables**: Variables use snake_case.
- **Constants**: Constants are written in uppercase with words separated by underscores.
- **Classes**: Class names use CamelCase.
- **Files**: File names use snake_case.

## Architectural Patterns
Based on the project structure and code analysis, the llm-planning-app project does not follow any specific architectural pattern. It appears to be a simple command-line application with a focus on code analysis and planning.

## Design Patterns
No specific design patterns were identified in the codebase.

## Coding Standards
The codebase follows the following coding standards:

- **Indentation**: The code uses 4 spaces for indentation.
- **Line Length**: Lines are limited to a maximum of 80 characters.
- **Comments**: Code comments are written in English and follow the [Python docstring conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling is implemented throughout the codebase.
- **Code Organization**: The code is organized into functions and classes, following a modular approach.

## Project Structure
The llm-planning-app project does not have a complex directory structure. It contains the following files at the top-level:

- **requirements.txt**: A file that lists the project dependencies.
- **README.md**: The project's README file that provides an overview and installation instructions.
- **llm_planner.py**: The main Python file that implements the llm-planning-app.
- **example_task.txt**: A text file containing an example task.
- **plan.md**: A markdown file for generating comprehensive plans.

## Example Usage
The project provides a set of commands that can be executed using the llm_planner.py file. Here are some example usages:

### Initializing Memory Bank
To initialize the memory bank with AI-generated content based on deep code analysis, run the following command:
```bash
python llm_planner.py init
```

### Creating a Plan
To generate a comprehensive plan for implementing a feature, run the following command:
```bash
python llm_planner.py plan your_feature.txt
```

### Updating Memory Bank
To update specific memory bank files with new insights, run the following command:
```bash
python llm_planner.py update projectbrief
```

## Installation
To install the llm-planning-app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Set up the API credentials for OpenAI, AWS (optional), and Azure (optional) by exporting the necessary environment variables.
